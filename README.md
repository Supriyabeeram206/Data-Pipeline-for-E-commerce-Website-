# Data-Pipeline-for-E-commerce-Website-

Overview
Develop a sophisticated data engineering pipeline to efficiently extract, transform, and analyze sales data generated by an e-commerce platform. Implement Apache Airflow to orchestrate the entire workflow ensuring reliability and scalability. Utilize ClickHouse as the analytical data warehouse, known for its speed and ability to generate real-time insights from vast datasets.

Architecture

Project Outline
Phase 1: Data Preparation
Acquire Dataset:

Secure an e-commerce sales dataset (either by sourcing an existing one or simulating transactions).
Ensure it captures key elements like purchase date, product details (name, category, price), quantity, and customer information if possible.
Clean and Transform:

Thoroughly clean the dataset, addressing missing entries, potential anomalies, and inconsistencies.
Normalize data formats as needed for streamlined analysis.
Phase 2: Data Infrastructure
ClickHouse Implementation:

Install and set up ClickHouse.
Design a table schema that aligns with your data and the analysis you intend to perform.
Airflow for Orchestration:

Install Apache Airflow.
Construct DAGs to automate the following:
Extraction: Pull data from your source system(s).
Transformation: Apply data cleaning and preparation logic.
Loading: Insert the transformed data into your ClickHouse data warehouse.
Scheduling: Set DAGs to execute on a chosen schedule (e.g., daily updates).
Key Considerations
Data Quality: Prioritize meticulous data cleaning to ensure downstream analysis is built on a solid foundation.
Scalability: Design your ClickHouse schema and Airflow workflows to handle increasing data volumes as your e-commerce business grows.
Key Achievements
Generated a scalable data pipeline using Apache Kafka for real-time data ingestion and Apache Spark for processing.
Handled ETL processes to transform raw sales data into actionable insights using Apache Airflow.
Deployed the solution on AWS with S3 for data storage and Redshift for data warehousing, ensuring data reliability and scalability.
